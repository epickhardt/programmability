### Setup virtual environment(Optional)

If you would like to isolate the dependencies of scrapli from the system, you can create a python virtual environment.

Install virtualenv package using pip. pip is a package installer for Python. Here I am using Python 3.8.5 version.
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Using virtualenv package, create a python virtual environment.
Refer [creation of python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
```
virtualenv napalm_venv
```
Now activate the virtual environment.
```
source ~/napalm_venv/bin/activate
```
### Install Napalm and its plugins

In the “napalm_venv” virtual environment, install **napalm**. At the moment of producing this tutorial, latest version of napalm is 3.3.1.
```
pip install napalm
```
Once you have all the required packages installed, go ahead and write the code to retrieve, configure or validate device data.
