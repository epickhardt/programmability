Are you a pro in CLI commands but tired of manually logging in to each network device and managing the network device configuration and operational data using the command line interface ? Then its time for you to explore Scrapli and automate CLI scraping !!!!

## What is Scrapli?

Scrapli is a python library that helps you to connect multiple network devices via SSH or Telnet, synchronously or asynchronously for screen scraping. Wondering what is screen scraping? well, it is the process of collecting screen display data from the network device and dumping it on to another screen or file. 

## Why Scrapli?

- Easy: It's easy to get going with scrapli -- check out the documentation and example links above, and you'll be connecting to devices in no time.
- Fast: Do you like to go fast? Of course you do! All of scrapli is built with speed in mind, but if you really feel the need for speed, check out the ssh2 transport plugin to take it to the next level!
- Great Developer Experience: scrapli has great editor support thanks to being fully typed; that plus thorough docs make developing with scrapli a breeze.
- Well Tested: Perhaps out of paranoia, but regardless of the reason, scrapli has lots of tests! Unit tests cover the basics, regularly ran functional tests connect to virtual routers to ensure that everything works IRL!
- Pluggable: scrapli provides a pluggable transport system -- don't like the currently available transports, simply extend the base classes and add your own! Need additional device support? Create a simple "platform" in scrapli_community to easily add new device support!
- But wait, there's more!: Have NETCONF devices in your environment, but love the speed and simplicity of scrapli? You're in luck! Check out scrapli_netconf!
- Concurrency on Easy Mode: Nornir's scrapli plugin gives you all the normal benefits of scrapli plus all the great features of Nornir.
